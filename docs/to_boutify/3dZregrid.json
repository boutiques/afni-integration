  " * If the input is a 3D+time dataset with slice-dependent time",
  "    offsets, the output will have its time offsets cleared.",
  "    It probably makes sense to do 3dTshift BEFORE using this",
  "    program in such a case.",
  " * The output of this program is centered around the same",
  "    location as the input dataset.  Slices outside the",
  "    original volume (e.g., when Z is increased) will be",
  "    zero.  This is NOT the same as using 3dZeropad, which",
  "    only adds zeros, and does not interpolate to a new grid.",
  " * Linear interpolation is used between slices.  However,",
  "    new slice positions outside the old volume but within",
  "    0.5 old slice thicknesses will get a copy of the last slice.",
  "    New slices outside this buffer zone will be all zeros.",

  " You have two 3D anatomical datasets from the same subject that",
  " need to be registered.  Unfortunately, the first one has slice",
  " thickness 1.2 mm and the second 1.3 mm.  Assuming they have",
  " the same number of slices, then do something like",
