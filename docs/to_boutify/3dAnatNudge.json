  " -epi eee    = eee is an EPI dataset [a mandatory option]",

  "NOTES",
  "*Systematically moves the anat dataset around and find the shift",
  "  that maximizes overlap between the anat dataset and the EPI",
  "  dataset.  No rotations are done.",
  "*Note that if you use -prefix, a new dataset will be created that",
  "  is a copy of the anat, except that it's origin will be shifted",
  "  and it will have a different ID code than the anat.  If you want",
  "  to use this new dataset as the anatomy parent for the EPI",
  "  datasets, you'll have to use",
  "    3drefit -apar ppp+orig eee1+orig eee2+orig ...",
  "*If no new dataset is written (no -prefix option), then you",
  "  can use the 3drefit command emitted at the end to modify",
  "  the origin of the anat dataset.  (Assuming you trust the",
  "  results - visual inspection is recommended!)",
  "*The reason the default search grid is mostly along the EPI y-axis",
  "  is that axis is usually the phase-encoding direction, which is",
  "  most subject to displacement due to off-resonance effects.",
  "*Note that the time this program takes will be proportional to",
  "  (2*nx+1)*(2*ny+1)*(2*nz+1), so using a very large search grid",
  "  will result in a very large usage of CPU time.",
  "*Recommended usage:",
  " + Make a 1-brick function volume from a typical EPI dataset:",
  "     3dbucket -fbuc -prefix epi_fb epi+orig",
  " + Use 3dIntracranial to scalp a T1-weighted volume:",
  "     3dIntracranial -anat spgr+orig -prefix spgr_st",
  " + Use 3dAnatNudge to produce a shifted anat dataset",
  "     3dAnatNudge -anat spgr_st+orig -epi epi_fb+orig -prefix spgr_nudge",
  " + Start AFNI and look at epi_fb overlaid in color on the",
  "    anat datasets spgr_st+orig and spgr_nudge+orig, to see if the",
  "    nudged dataset seems like a better fit.",
  " + Delete the nudged dataset spgr_nudge.",
  " + If the nudged dataset DOES look better, then apply the",
  "    3drefit command output by 3dAnatNudge to spgr+orig.",
  "*Note that the x-, y-, and z-axes for the epi and anat datasets",
  "  may point in different directions (e.g., axial SPGR and",
  "  coronal EPI).  The 3drefit command applies to the anat",
  "  dataset, NOT to the EPI dataset.",
  "*If the program runs successfully, the only thing set to stdout",
  "  will be the 3drefit command string; all other messages go to",
  "  stderr.  This can be useful if you want to capture the command",
  "  to a shell variable and then execute it, as in the following",

  "     if( $cvar[1] == \"3drefit\" ) $cvar",
