  "\tWith the -nt option: Ifile uses the variable 'User Variable 17' in the ",
  "\tI file's header. This option appears to be augmented each time a new",
  "\tscan is started. (Thanks to S. Marrett for discovering the elusive variable.)",
  "\tWithout -nt option: Ifile first examines the modification time for each image and ",
  "\tinfers from that which images form a single scan. Consecutive images that are less ",
  "\tthan T seconds apart belong to the same scan. T is set based on the mean",
  "\ttime delay difference between successive images. The threshold currently",
  "\tused works for the test data that we have. If it fails for your data, let us",
  "\tknow and supply us with the data. Once a set of images is grouped into a ",
  "\tscan the sequence of slice location is analysed and duplicate, missing slices,",
  "\tand incomplete volumes are detected. Sets of images that do not pass these tests",
  "\tare ignored.",

  "Preserving Time Info: (not necessary with -nt option but does not hurt to preserve anyway)",
  "\tIt is important to preserve the file modification time info as you copy or untar",
  "\tthe data. If you neglect to do so and fail to write down where each scan ends",
  "\tand/or begins, you might have a hell of a time reconstructing your data.",
  "\tWhen copying image directories, use:",
  "\t   cp -rp ???/* TARGET/ ",

  "Future Improvements:",
  "\tOut of justifiable laziness, and for other less convincing reasons, I have left ",
  "\tIfile and @RenamePanga separate. They can be combined into one program but it's usage",
  "\twould become more complicated. At any rate, the user should not notice any difference",
